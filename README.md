# User Data Management Application

This React application allows users to manage their data through a simple form and home page interface. The application uses React's Context API to manage and pass user data between components.

## Project Structure

- **Form Component (Form.jsx)**: 
  - A form that allows users to input and manage their data such as name, email, and other details.
  - The data entered in the form is managed using React's state and context.
  
- **Home Component (Home.jsx)**:
  - Displays the user data entered through the form.
  - Provides an overview of the current state of the user data.

- **CSS Styles (homeStyle.css)**:
  - Styles the Home component to give it a visually appealing and organized layout.
